For signature schemes, most use a random value [^1] that can be used for detecting duplicates.  For HPKE, the encryption contains a fresh random share for each encryption (called `enc`) that can be used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nI need to improve my description of anti-replay; I'll take that up separately.\r\n\r\n[^1]: ...technically just unpredictable and probably unique",
